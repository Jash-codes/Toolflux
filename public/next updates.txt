Add Search Functionality: We could add a search bar to the "Categories" and "Tools" pages. This would let users instantly find a specific tool or category without having to scroll through the lists.

Create a "Submit a Tool" Form: The "Submit a Tool" button in the navbar could lead to a new page with a form where users can suggest new AI tools to be added to the directory.

Implement Pagination: The "AI Detection" and "Chat" categories have over 20 tools. As the lists grow, a single page can get very long. We could add "Next" and "Previous" page buttons to the bottom of the tool lists to keep them organized.

Build Individual Tool Pages: Right now, clicking "Visit Tool" takes the user to an external site. We could change this so that clicking the card first takes them to a dedicated page on ToolFlux with more details, reviews, and tutorials about that specific tool, with the external link on that page.
